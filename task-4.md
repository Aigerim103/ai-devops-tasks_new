High memory usage in a Docker container can be caused by several factors, including application memory leaks, improper resource limits, or inefficient code. Here are steps to diagnose and solve high memory usage:

---

## 1. **Set Resource Limits**
By default, containers can use as much memory as the host allows. Set memory limits to prevent a container from consuming all available memory:

```sh
docker run -m 512m --memory-swap 1g my_image
```
- `-m 512m`: Limit container to 512MB RAM.
- `--memory-swap 1g`: Total memory + swap.

**In Docker Compose:**
```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    image: my_image
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
```

---

## 2. **Monitor Memory Usage**
Use Docker stats to monitor memory usage:
```sh
docker stats
```
Or inspect a specific container:
```sh
docker inspect <container_id>
```

---

## 3. **Optimize Your Application**
- **Fix memory leaks:** Profile your application for leaks.
- **Reduce memory footprint:** Optimize code, use efficient libraries, and avoid loading large datasets into memory.
- **Tune garbage collection:** For languages like Java or Node.js, adjust GC settings.

---

## 4. **Use Alpine or Slim Images**
Base your image on lightweight distributions (e.g., `alpine`) to reduce overhead.

---

## 5. **Multi-Stage Builds**
Use multi-stage builds to keep your final image small, which can help reduce memory usage at runtime.

---

## 6. **Check for Zombie Processes**
Zombie or orphaned processes can consume memory. Use:
```sh
docker exec -it <container_id> ps aux
```
Kill unnecessary processes.

---

## 7. **Increase Host Memory or Scale Out**
If your application genuinely needs more memory, consider:
- Adding more memory to the host.
- Scaling out (running multiple containers).

---

## 8. **Enable Swap (with caution)**
Allowing swap can prevent OOM kills, but may degrade performance:
```sh
docker run -m 512m --memory-swap 1g my_image
```

---

## 9. **Review Application Logs**
Check logs for errors or warnings about memory usage.

---

## 10. **Restart Policy**
Set a restart policy to recover from OOM kills:
```sh
docker run --restart=on-failure my_image
```
