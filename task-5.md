Certainly! Here’s a simple ASCII art diagram showing the relationship between a **Client**, an **Application Server**, and a **Database**:

```
+--------+         +-------------------+         +-----------+
| Client | <-----> | Application Server| <-----> | Database  |
+--------+         +-------------------+         +-----------+
```

**Legend:**
- The arrows `<----->` represent communication between the components.
- The **Client** could be a web browser or mobile app.
- The **Application Server** runs your backend logic.
- The **Database** stores your data.

Absolutely! Here’s an improved ASCII diagram with **labels** and **data flow directions**:

```
   [Client]
      |
      | 1. Request
      v
+-----------+         +-------------------+         +-----------+
|  Client   | ----->  | Application Server| ----->  | Database  |
+-----------+         +-------------------+         +-----------+
      ^                       |                          |
      |                       | 2. Response/Data         |
      +-----------------------+<-------------------------+
```

**Data Flow:**
1. The **Client** sends a request to the **Application Server**.
2. The **Application Server** queries the **Database** and sends data back to the **Client**.

**Labels:**
- Each box is labeled for its role.
- Arrows (`----->`) show the direction of data flow.
- The numbers indicate the sequence of the data flow.
