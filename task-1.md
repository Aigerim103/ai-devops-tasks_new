DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophy that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates more frequently and reliably. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), monitoring, and feedback between development and operations teams to create a more streamlined and efficient software delivery pipeline. DevOps culture promotes shared responsibility, transparency, and rapid iteration, enabling organizations to respond faster to customer needs and market changes while maintaining high quality and stability of their software systems.
Let me search for the most up-to-date information about popular DevOps tools.

Based on my research of the most current DevOps statistics and trends, here are the 3 most popular tools used in DevOps:

1. Docker - Leading containerization platform with over 42% market share in the DevOps tech stack. It enables DevOps teams to package and deploy software in containers, creating automated build and deployment workflows.

2. Kubernetes - Close second with 28% adoption rate among DevOps teams. It's the dominant container orchestration platform used for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale.

3. Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Commands 31% of the cloud computing market and is the third most used tool in DevOps tech stacks at 12%. AWS provides comprehensive DevOps services for building and delivering products.

These three tools form the backbone of modern DevOps practices, with Docker handling containerization, Kubernetes managing container orchestration, and AWS providing the cloud infrastructure and services. Their high adoption rates and market dominance reflect their critical role in enabling automated, scalable, and efficient DevOps workflows.
