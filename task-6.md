Certainly! Here’s a basic Mermaid diagram for a CI/CD process:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Commit] --> B[Build]
    B --> C[Test]
    C --> D[Deploy]
```

**How to use:**
- Copy the code above.
- Paste it into a Markdown file or a Mermaid live editor (like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)).
- You’ll see a flowchart showing the CI/CD steps: **Commit → Build → Test → Deploy**.
